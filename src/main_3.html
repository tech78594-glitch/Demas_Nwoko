                <h1>The Story</h1>
                <p>We remember our quick three-hour session with Baba in Ibadan.</p>
                <p>We were researching <strong>Africanfuturism in Architecture</strong> and its impact on the <strong>African's health and wellness.</strong> At the time, there was not much work on this. Baba's was one of the <strong>authentic few.</strong></p>
                <p>For me, it felt like a dream—encountering in person someone we had only read about in our Visual Arts classes.</p>
                <p>Among the many invaluable wisdoms Baba deposited in us during that session, <strong>one thing stood out:</strong><br>Baba did not care for labels—African or traditional</p>
                <p>He recounted receiveing an award abroad, where foreigners asked him what type of architecture he identified with.<br>Was it vernacular?</p>
                <p>He replied:<br>"if it is not vernacular, what else is there? Vernacular is your mother's tongue—that is your nature. So how can yu design for your client without understanding his vernacular?"</p>
                <p>To Baba, <strong>vernacular is the natural langauge of design.</strong></p>
                <p>So this <strong>mini-hybrid exhibit project</strong> takes on the life of Baba's vernacular—to <strong>visually reinterpret and explore his heartbeat through art.</strong></p>
                <p>As architects, we took to the <strong>paintbrush, the pen, and the mouse</strong> to tell Baba's story.<br><strong>So, join us for the ride.</strong></p>

            <h1>The Journey</h1>
            <h2>We already know Baba's history. Check Google if you don't.<br>We are not here for that—rather, <strong>we are here to tell his story</strong></h2>
            <p>We did not begin this work by asking who Demas Nwoko is.</p>
            <p>we began by listening to what his work has been saying all along.</p>
            <p>Across bukidings, artworks, spaces, and silences, one idea kept returning—quietly, insitently, without explanation:<br><strong>Vernacular is the natural langauge of design.</strong></p>
            <p>This project is not merely an archive or a catalogue.<br>It is our journey of encountering that philosophy, sitting with it, and allowing it to shape how we <strong>see space, culture, and making.</strong></p>
            <p>It is our journey of <strong>capturing Baba's heart,<br>telling his story,</strong>and <strong>shaping his legacy.</strong></p>

            <h1>His Roots His Future</h1>
            <h2>Baba's journey into vernacular began <strong>before</strong> the days of the Zaria Art Society.</h2>
            <p>from the start, Baba sought not to imitate foreign aesthetics, but to <strong>root modern art and architecture in the soil of Nigerian life</strong>—its materials, rhythms, and cosmology.</p>
            <p>He saw design not as a borrowed langauge, but as a <strong>living dialect of place.</strong></p>
            <p>In his words and in his practice, vernacular was not a limitation—<strong>it was the heartbeat of design itself.</strong></p>
            <p>It was how culture spoke through <strong>space, texture, and form.</strong></p>

            <h1>His Roots His Future</h1>
            <p>So when Temi paints this piece, she tells the story of his beginning—<br>his longing to tell the story of his fathers.</p>
            <p>And so we painted patterns that speak of <strong>material honesty, spatial rhythm, and continuity.</strong></p>
            <p>You see how firmly he held onto his roots to shape his future.</p>
            <p>We dare say:<br>His roots are his future.</p>

            <p>Vernacular, in Demas Nwoko's work, is <strong>not nostalgia.</strong></p>
            <p>It is not tradition preserved behind glass.</p>
            <p>It is not the past repeated.</p>
            <p>It is <strong>langauge</strong>—a living system through which people, materials, climate, sound, ritual, and belief spaek to one another.</p>
            <p>A langauge learned not in classrooms, but through <strong>proximity</strong>—to land, to craft, to use, to meaning.</p>
            <p>In his architecture, walls do not merely enclose space;<br>they <strong>respond</strong>—to heat, to light, to movement, to gathering.</p>
            <p>In his art, form deos not decorate; <string>it remembers.</string><br>In his philosophy, design is not imposed—<strong>it emerges.</strong></p>
            <p>To work vernacularly is not to reject modernity,<br>but to <strong>translate it.</strong></p>

            <h1>His Heartbeat, His Legacy</h1>
            <p>And so, in trying to capture his heartbeat, Temi remembers the saying:<br><strong>"The eyes are the window to the soul."</strong></p>
            <p>There was no better way than to trace each line with his words,<br>to lay each colour with his fire,<br>and to draw from the permanence of his heart</p>

            <p><strong>That is his real legacy.</strong></p>
            <p>That is excatly what are captured in this piece—<br>his legacy not merely in achievements,<br>but in the spaces and works taht still speak,<br>and in the people he has inspired.</p>
            <p>The hearts he has lit with fire—<br><strong>a fire to speak our vernacular,</strong><br>and create what is truly ours.</p>

            <p>John saw Demas Nwoko's story and saw a man emerging from a path rich with wisdom, rich with identity.</p>
            <p>A man who knows not only where he is going, but remembers where he is coming from.</p>

            <h1>The Art Piece</h1>
            <p>This piece does not attempt to portray Demas Nwoko as a figure.</p>
            <p>It portrays him as a <strong>condition.</strong></p>
            <p>A man shaped by soil.<br>And shaping with soil.</p>
            <p>The relief emerges rather than stands apart suggesting that authorship, in vernacular practice, is <strong>never detached from place.</strong></p>
            <p>The surface is intentionally restrained.<br>No excess.<br>No spectacle.</p>
            <p><strong>Simply a silent revolution.</strong></p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>This project began as a gift.<br>But it quickly br=ecame a question.</p>
            <p>What does it mean to design when vernacular is treated not a reference, but as <strong>spirit?</strong></p>
            <p>What happens when soil is not a backdrop, but a <strong>collaborator?</strong></p>
            <p>We realised that to tell this story truthfully, we could not speak about Demas Nwoko in the usual way.</p>
            <p>Instead, we chose to speak <strong>through the ideas his work has given us.</strong></p>
            <p>The postcards.<br>The low-relief art piece.<br>This digital space.</p>
            <p>Each is an interpretation<br>our way of translating philosophy into form.</p>

            <h1>This Is Not an Ending</h1>
            <p>To say vernacular is the natural langauge of design is not a romantic claim.<br>It is a <strong>practical</strong> one.</p>
            <p>In a time when global design trends move faster than local realities,<br>Demas Nwoko's work reminds us that <strong>releveance comes from alignment, not speed.</strong></p>
            <p>If his work has been recognised beyind Nigeria,<br>it is because it never tried to leave home first.</p>
            <p>This landing page is not a conclusion.<br>It is an opening.</p>
            <p>An invitation to see vernacular<br>not as style, but as <strong>systems.</strong><br>Not as memory, but as <strong>method.</strong><br>Not as resistance, but as <strong>fluency.</strong></p>
            <p>The langauge was always there.</p>
